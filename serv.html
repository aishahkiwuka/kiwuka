                    <h3>HEALTH TIPS</h3>
                    <p>we encourage persons with disabilities to eat wel in order to avoid other types of disabilities
                        Plan meals ahead of time to ward off unhealthy temptations.
                        Upgrade to healthier ingredients. For example, make an omelet with egg whites and vegetables,
                        instead of piling on cheese and sausage.
                        Serve yourself smaller portions.
                        Slow down when you eat. You'll give your body a chance to feel full.</p>
                    <p>Make fitness a part of your daily life. A good goal is 150 minutes of moderate exercise each
                        week. You can break that into five sessions if each session lasts for 30 minutes. Or you can do
                        it for less time, as long as you make your activity more challenging</p>

                    <h3>SRHR</h3>
                    <p>The World Health Organization estimates that 15 per cent of the world’s population have a
                        disability and that a higher prevalence of disability occurs among people in lower-income
                        countries, Persons with disabilities can have widely varying needs and experiences, depending
                        on factors such as whether they have experienced their disability from birth or later in life,
                        or if they live independently or not. However, all have sexual and reproductive health needs
                        and rights, yet it is an area that can be neglected in health and development policy, and the
                        barriers preventing access to these rights can be widespread. It is therefore crucial to
                        recognise and challenge these barriers in order to provide essential sexual and reproductive
                        education that not only includes disease prevention, but also relationships, fertility desires,
                        and pleasure</p>

                    <h2>PREVENTIVE MEASURES OF SECONDARY DISABILITY HEALTH WISE</h2>
                    <h4 class="card-title">Primary Prevention</h4>
                    <p>The phrase “prevention is better than cure” is one that many people are familiar with and is the
                        focus of primary prevention. Primary prevention is directed at avoidance and uses interventions
                        that prevent health conditions from occurring. These interventions are mainly aimed at
                        people (e.g. changing health behaviours, immunization, nutrition) and the environments in which
                        we live (safe water supplies, sanitation, good living and working conditions). Primary
                        prevention is equally important for people with and without disabilities and is the main focus
                        of this element</p>
                    <h4 class="card-title">Secondary Prevention</h4>
                    <p>This is the early detection and early treatment of health conditions, with the aim of curing or
                        lessening their impacts. Examples of early detection include mammograms to detect breast cancer
                        and eye examinations to detect cataracts; examples of early treatment include treatment of
                        trachoma with antibiotics to prevent blindness, multidrug treatment of leprosy to prevent
                        disease progression and appropriate handling of a fractured bone to promote proper healing and
                        prevention of deformity. Secondary prevention strategies for people both with and without
                        disabilities are discussed in the Medical care element</p>
                    <h4 class="card-title">Tertiary Prevention</h4>
                    <p>This aims to limit or reverse the impact of already existing health conditions and impairments;
                        it includes rehabilitation services and interventions that aim to prevent activity limitations
                        and to promote independence, participation and inclusion. Tertiary prevention strategies are
                        discussed in the elements on Rehabilitation and Assistive devices</p>
